---->Factories (Model Factories)  :

Laravel has a feature called model factories that allows you 
to build fake data for your models. It is very useful for testing
 and seeding fake data into your database to see your code in 
action before any real user data comes in 







------------------------
 Props are just data that we want to pass through to that component 
so that we can use it within the component.
 So we can read/use it whenever we like within that component.
